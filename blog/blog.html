            <blockquote>This week on our Friends on Friday guest blog post, my colleague John Huehn writes about the use of text messaging as a customer service platform. I think he is spot on, especially if my daughter is any indication of the future of texting! <cite>– <a href = "">Shep Hyken</a></cite>

            <h2>Customer&hyphen;Focused</h2>
            <p>In the past I’ve written about proactive customer service. The example I always like to use is when a server in a restaurant notices that the guest’s water glass is about half full, the server refills the glass before the guest drinks it all and has to ask for more. Being proactive raises the perceived value of what you offer. Your customers feel you’ve really are paying attention and focused on them and their needs.</p>

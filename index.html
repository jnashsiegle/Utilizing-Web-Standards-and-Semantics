                    <p>I am a digital immigrant.  The computer skills currently possessed up until the past year are completely self-taught and began about 20 years ago.  My initial job using my newly found skills were with United Space Alliance at JSC on the International Space Station Program where I worked with the software developers breaking the software and what in essence now is known as UX Design.  It was during this time period that I first began teaching myself web programming, during the days of HTML 4 and the very beginning of cascading style sheets.  From there I moved on to working with various startups pre-dot.com bubble bursting.   The first of these was with the company who was key to the installation of the first laptop lanes in airports and wireless coverage in restaurants and hotels.  (Wayport, Inc.).  Next I moved on to T-Manage whose specialty was setting up the VPN's for fortune 500 companies so that their employees across the nation and world could work at home, remotely.  After this I took a brief respite and opened a small restaurant located within the small community I lived in. (I sold it as a successful business 5 years later.) </p>
                    <p>Approximately two years ago, I once again came back to the skills I'd left behind when I opened the restaurant and began puttering around installing Linux and two older computers and digging once again into HTML which was now 5 and cascading style sheets which were now called CSS3.  I was flabbergasted at the changes that had taken place, but not only that I was astounded at what was now able to be accomplished within the realm of websites, or should I say web and mobile apps.  Finding myself totally drifting unsure exactly what was best to learn and when I ran across Full Sail University, found the curriculum to be exactly what I was wanting and...Here I am.</p>
                    <p>I am married with three grown children and 3.5 grandchildren. (I was a very young Nana).  My husband is a two-time Cancer survivor and is my biggest fan but totally technologically handicapped, and he will admit this.  He is hugely into music, plays the keyboards with a past involved in several bands in his younger days and playing in piano bars though now he is a Worship Director and focuses his passion into that and teaching our younger generation private lessons as well as theatre and worship arts.  He also comes from a law enforcement/corporate security background and is NRA certified to teach a myriad of Gun Safety/Weapons/Law Enforcement classes.</p>
                    <p>Back to my preferences when it comes to Web Development and Design; I love minimalistic design.  I do not like "busy" websites.  I am a complete believer in the philosophy less is more.  As well, I am on the fence when it comes to the "Mobile First" vs. "Desktop First" workflow of design and development.  I tend to work backwords and am much more at ease doing so, however I believe it also should be decided at a project by project basis.  After all it would make no sense to design something at a desktop resolution if it is not going to be utilized there.</p>
                    <p>It is my hope after graduation to move on to a Master's Program, possibly the New Media Journalism Master's program to build up a little bit more of a foundation within the Digital World.  I love photography, photomanipulation, reading, and quiet time with my family.  Oddly, fun for me, is exploring new software and working on areas of Development that I don't have time to do during the semester.</p>
                    <p>I hope to procur enough work after graduation to allow my husband a bit of time to "semi-retire", and while it would be real easy to feel anxious about the fact I am *^ years old and most Development companies, at least the majority seem to prefer those many years younger than I am.  I have a plan and a vision to fall back on, and goals I want to accomplish that don't involve the necessity of joining an outside company if it is not possible.  Though I would like the experience of learning from a team of developers and designers if such a door were to open.</p>

							<h1>Personal</h1>

							<p>I am married with three grown children and 3.5 grandchildren. (I was a very young Nana).  My husband is a two-time Cancer survivor and is my biggest fan but totally technologically handicapped, and he will admit this.  He is hugely into music, plays the keyboards with a past involved in several bands in his younger days and playing in piano bars though now he is a Worship Director and focuses his passion into that and teaching our younger generation private lessons as well as theatre and worship arts.  He also comes from a law enforcement/corporate security background and is NRA certified to teach a myriad of Gun Safety/Weapons/Law Enforcement classes.</p>
							<p>It is my hope after graduation to move on to a Master's Program, possibly the New Media Journalism Master's program to build up a little bit more of a foundation within the Digital World.  I love photography, photomanipulation, reading, and quiet time with my family.  Oddly, fun for me, is exploring new software and working on areas of Development that I don't have time to do during the semester.  I collect hummingbirds and lighthouses.</p>

							<h1>Professional</h1>
							<p>I am a digital immigrant.  My initial technology related position was with United Space Alliance at the Johnson Space Center.  Here I was assigned to the International Space Station Program where I worked with the software developers as a software tester, and what in essence now is known as UX Design.  From there I moved on to working with various startup companies before the dot.com bubble burst. </p>
							<p>When it comes to Web Development and Design; I love minimalistic design.  I do not like "busy" websites.  I am a complete believer in the philosophy less is more.  As well, I am on the fence when it comes to the "Mobile First" vs. "Desktop First" workflow of design and development.  I tend to work backwards and am much more at ease doing so, however I believe it also should be decided at a project by project basis.  After all it would make no sense to design something at a desktop resolution if it is not going to be utilized there.</p>
							<p>Upon graduation it is my vision to use my skills to bring ministries, non-profit organizations and faith-based groups to the Internet with the most current and trends.</p>
